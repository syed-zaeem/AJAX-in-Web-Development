Instructions to run the project locally

To run the real-time data dashboard with Web Workers locally, follow these simple 
instructions:

 First of all, you have to clone the project repository to your local machine. For this 
purpose, open your terminal and run the following command:
git clone [repository_url]
 Then, you have to change into the project directory. For this purpose, in the 
same terminal, run the following command:
cd real-time-dashboard-ajax
 Then, use a text editor of your choice to open the project files. For example, you 
can use Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any editor you are comfortable with.
 Then, locate the index.html file in the project directory and open it in a web 
browser. You can simply double-click the file or right-click and choose 'Open with' 
to select your preferred browser.
 Once the project is open in your web browser, you'll see the real-time data 
dashboard. Enter a user ID in the provided input field and click the "Fetch Data"
